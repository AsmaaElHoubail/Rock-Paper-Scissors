# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows a user to play against the computer, selecting one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer also selects one of these options at random. The winner of the game is determined by the classic rules of Rock Paper Scissors:

-   Rock beats scissors
-   Scissors beats paper
-   Paper beats rock

## How to Play

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The game interface will appear, displaying buttons for each of the three options: rock, paper, and scissors. Click on the button corresponding to your choice, and the computer will immediately make its selection. The winner of the game will be displayed on the screen.
